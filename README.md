# GoFritzBox

GoFritzBox is a Golang utility to read or modify Fritz!Box parameters.

### Why it is not complete?
Because AVMDE didn't release a documentation for its APIs, building this library is very hard and I won't lose my time building functions that nobody will use.

## Supported features:
* Login
* LoadInfo 
* GetStats

If you need another feature you can open an issue and I will try to add it.
Soon will be added ways to edit the Fritz!Box configuration, with an auto CRC32 signature.
